# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   | 15 |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       | 1.000 | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)  | 15.000 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 1.500 |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 45.000 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |   10 calendar weeks                |
